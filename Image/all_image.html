    <p>Located on the northwest coast of Java, Jakarta is the country's economic,
        39 cultural and political centre, and with a population of 9,761,407 as of
        40 December 2012, it is the most populous city in Indonesia and in Southeast Asia.
        41 The official metropolitan area, known as Jabodetabek (a name formed by
        42 combining the initial syllables of Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang and
        43 Bekasi), is the second largest in the world, yet the metropolis's suburbs still
        44 continue beyond it.</p>

    <p>Established in the fourth century, the city became an important trading
        47 port for the Kingdom of Sunda. It was the de facto capital of the Dutch East
        48 Indies (known as Batavia at that time). Today, the city has continued as the
        49 capital of Indonesia since the country's independence was declared in 1945.
        50 The city is currently the seat of the ASEAN Secretariat.</p>
